# Introduction
Hi! I'm Tyler Bloom, and welcome to my blog. I'm a Rust developer, and that's what I'll spend most of my time talking about on here, though I might write about anything. I started writing Rust during my final year of grad school (around Oct. 2021), and I haven't looked back. Since then, nearly all of the code that I write both personally and professional is Rust.

# What you'll find here
I fundamentally believe in the philosophy of open information, including open source. That is my *raison d'etre*, so everything you read here starts with a desire share what I've learned, what I'm thinking about, what I've built, and what I can teach. These are all interrelated, so a blog post that emphasis one of those will be largely motivated by the other.

A particularly favorite topic of mine is building an intuition for systems based on the rules of Rust. In my main educational series, Rust from First Principle, I walk through different libraries and help construct working mental models using a basic idea and several API signatures.

# Closing
I hope you enjoy your time here. If you want to contact me, the easiest way is via email (linked below) or on Discord. If you'd like to see what I am/have worked on, check out the projects tab or my GitHub.
