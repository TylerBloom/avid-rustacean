<p>This is my introductory post for my Rust education series, Rust from First Principles. I dig into what it means for a language to be "hard to learn" and introduce a framework for reasoning about Rust code to deepen your understanding.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="intro"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#intro" aria-label="Anchor link for: intro">Intro</a></h2>
<p>Rust is generally considered a hard language to learn. This is true, to a degree. There are certainly many challenges to learning the language because it forces you to solve problems that you would normally put off until testing (or see a bug report for). Still, I think the label of "hard language to learn" misses a lot of context and is only true for certain definitions of what it means to "learn" something.</p>
<p>Learning is a constant, active process. The degree to which a language is "hard to learn" should take into account someone's entire career with the language. This requires us to take a step back. For Rust, there is a steep initial climb no matter what your background is; but, after you learn the building blocks, Rust becomes significantly easier to grow with. This differs from most other languages that seems to present a series of "fun" and "unique" problems at every stage of growth.</p>
<p>This is the first post in what I hope to be this blog's flagship series. I want to explore different areas of the standard library and the broader ecosystem in order to explain how they work from the ground up. But, this will not be a code review. In fact, most of the code will just be function and type signatures. My goal is to provide a functional explanation by reasoning with the fundamentals to quickly arrive at different levels of actionable understanding. I will not be focusing on any particular level of understanding, though some topics will naturally skew more beginner or advanced. Instead, I intend to provide a framework for you to quickly finding the level of understanding you need/want while keeping the ability to progress as needed.</p>
<p>So, join me was we learn Rust from First Principles.</p>
<h2 id="abstractions-all-the-way-down"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#abstractions-all-the-way-down" aria-label="Anchor link for: abstractions-all-the-way-down">Abstractions all the way down</a></h2>
<p>Computer science is just abstractions on abstractions on abstractions... After all, ones and zeros do not actually exist on your computer (well, "one"s and "zero"s don't really exist...). There are two aspects of an abstraction that determine its quality, completeness and being "leak proof". That is, a good abstraction covers everything you want it to cover and nothing that you do not.</p>
<p>The primary goal of any programming language is to provide you with a set of core abstractions so you don't need to think about the nitty gritty details. There are times where you need to dive into the weeds, but the type and quality of abstractions dictate the frequency that you must do that. This is where Rust excels. It's core abstractions combine to provide a near complete and mostly leak proof foundation on which to build. Moreover, by understanding a few of them, you can gain an understanding of the others.</p>
<h2 id="oh-look-threads"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#oh-look-threads" aria-label="Anchor link for: oh-look-threads">Oh look, threads</a></h2>
<p>As an example, let's take one of the foundation rules of Rust: "any instance of type <code>T</code> must be valid." This is where we get ideas like "there are no null values", but this is also where we get the idea of lifetimes (among many others). References are just types, but they must point to a valid instance of <code>T</code>. Therefore, the language must track when that instance might be moved or deconstructed in order to ensure the validity of a <code>&amp;T</code>. This is gets particularly tricky once threads enter the picture.</p>
<p>If two threads are sharing data, and that value lives on one thread's stack, the owning thread needs to not end while the other thread is running. If it does, that value will no longer exist, making the borrowing thread's reference invalid. So, the language needs to be able to describe that a value doesn't live elsewhere on a stack and isn't owned by anything elsewhere on a stack. And it does, that value must be <code>'static</code>! The standard library's thread spawn function even points this out:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#282828;color:#fdf4c1aa;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#928374;">// From std::thread::spawn
</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">pub fn </span><span style="color:#8ec07c;">spawn</span><span>&lt;F, T&gt;(</span><span style="color:#fdf4c1;">f</span><span>: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;
</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">where
</span><span>    F: FnOnce() -&gt; T + Send + </span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;static</span><span>,
</span><span>    T: Send + </span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;static</span><span>,
</span></code></pre>
<p>For this conversation, we can ignore all bounds except lifetimes. The function that we give the other thread needs to not borrow anything from the caller's scope, and the value that is return (from the other thread) needs to not borrow anything from the thread's scope. This is where Rust gets must of its utility over other languages. These rules allow you to think about much higher level details without concerns of data validity.</p>
<h2 id="level-up-or-not"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#level-up-or-not" aria-label="Anchor link for: level-up-or-not">Level up (or not)</a></h2>
<p>Through a short chain of questions, we can explain why <code>std::thread::spawn</code>'s argument needs to be <code>'static</code>. While this is a nice tool for recalling details, it is not necessary to go through. If you just needed to get something working, you don't need to go down that rabbit hole. You can simply work with the requirement as given by putting a <code>move</code> in from of the closure you give. Then, if you want, you can return to more deeply understand why. In this way, Rust clearly signposts its rabbit holes to let you focus on key details of your project instead of the minutia.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, this has been my experience with learning Rust. You have an idea, you hit a bump, you work within the given constraints, and then, after you have a working product, you can return to improve your understanding (and maybe even your system). Over the course of my knowing how to code, my experience with Rust is an anomaly. None of the other languages that I have used (Python, C++, and some JS) have given me the tools to better understand the language. Moreover, none of those languages have made me feel secure leaving the details un-investigated until later.</p>
<p>Working with excellent abstractions like this allows you to easily render mental models of systems into code (and visa versa). Let's expand on the thread example from before. Maybe we have a large data structure that would be expensive to move to another thread or to clone, but we still need data to be shared. Well, you could reach for an <code>Arc</code>, but that would require learning a new mental model around "shared ownership" as well as moving this large object onto the heap. The rule from before is that the thread owning the data can not end before the other thread is done. And the standard library has something for this, a thread scope!</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#282828;color:#fdf4c1aa;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="font-style:italic;color:#928374;">// From std::thread::{scope, Scope}
</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">pub fn </span><span style="color:#8ec07c;">scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;env</span><span>, F, T&gt;(</span><span style="color:#fdf4c1;">f</span><span>: F) -&gt; T
</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">where
</span><span>    F: </span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">for</span><span>&lt;</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;scope</span><span>&gt; FnOnce(</span><span style="color:#fe8019;">&amp;</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;scope </span><span>Scope&lt;</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;scope</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;env</span><span>&gt;) -&gt; T, { </span><span style="color:#fe8019;">.. </span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">pub struct </span><span style="color:#8ec07c;">Scope</span><span>&lt;</span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;scope</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;env</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#fa5c4b;">&#39;scope</span><span>&gt; { </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#928374;">/* private fields */ </span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, if you just wanted to get something working that shared data between threads, you can end things here. Start with an example in the docs and look at the methods on the <code>Scope</code> struct, and you're off to the races!</p>
<p>If you want to learn a bit more, this one is a bit harder to parse. Since we care about certain threads living longer than others, that should provide a clue that we're mostly interested in the lifetimes. The <code>scope</code> function takes a function that lives at least as long as the <code>'scope</code> lifetime, and that function takes a single argument, a <code>Scope</code> struct. In the <code>Scope</code> struct's definition, we can find the rest of the information we need. The <code>Scope</code> struct captures two lifetimes, <code>'scope</code> and <code>'env</code>. We can see that <code>'env</code> must live for at least as long as <code>'scope</code> (i.e. <code>'env: 'scope</code>). This maps fairly cleanly onto the mental model: that the owning thread needs to live as long as the spawned (borrowing) thread. This allows the spawned thread to capture references to the surrounding environment and ensures that its inner scope is not longer than the outer scope.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#wrap-up" aria-label="Anchor link for: wrap-up">Wrap-up</a></h2>
<p>This series will be centered on this process. Given a subject, we will formulate a simple mental model and then either build a system to match that model or see how that model gets translated into code. Then, we can work these two in tandem to improve both the overall system and our understanding to whatever level you need/desire.</p>
<p>Beyond bringing particular concepts into sharper focus, my larger goal is to make Rust code that is not your own more approachable. The standard library is (mostly) not magic. Tokio is not magic. And nearly all other code you will encounter is not magic (except for macros... they are kind of magic). You too have the ability to reason about such esteemed crates.</p>
<p>Next time, I think I'll discuss statics. If that sounds interesting, I'll see you there!</p>
